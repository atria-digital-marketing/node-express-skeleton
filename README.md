## Node.js/Express Skeleton Application

> The purpose of this application is to provide a quick template to get up and running with a node.js application backed by Express.

To get started from root directory:

- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn start`
- navigate to `localhost:3000` or whatever port specified in your `.env` file

That's it! You're up and running, you can now start fleshing out your new API.
